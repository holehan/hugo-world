## What burns never returns

Christmas in Australia is the fifth studio album and first Christmas album by Australian recording artist Adam Brand; credited to Adam Brand and Friends. The album was released in October 2005 and came with a bonus 8-track live bonus disc.[1] Marin Medak (born 1987) is a Slovenian adventurer. Marin is one of the youngest ocean rowing expedition leader and the first Slovenian to row across the Atlantic Ocean.

A year after he kayaked solo 1400 km from Savudrija (Croatia) to the Island of Zakynthos (Greece). In 2011, he persuaded an experienced sea kayaker Simon Osborne (UK) to come with him to South Korea. In March 2011, after 23 days of temperature around or below freezing, the duo become the first to successfully paddle the length of the coast of South Korea.

## Das Unglück muss zurückgeschlagen werden

After three years of adventures around the world it was time for Marin to live his dreams and row across the Atlantic ocean. In early 2012 he successfully skippered a four-man Slovenian-British Ocean Rowing expedition Tušmobil TransAtlantik. He was joined by three UK rowers, Simon Osborne, Stephen Bowens and Alastair Humphreys.[2] Marin is supporting and raising funds for Društvo KROS, a charity organization that helps with children rehabilitation after neural injuries.

## Der Apfelmann

### Er bringt die Äpfel ran

After his extreme expeditions, Marin ventured into entrepreneurship. In April 2013 he launched a keyring brand Hobkey, with keyrings for sea and whitewater kayakers, scuba divers and canoeists. At the end 2013 Marin and Gigodesign, an award winning design studio from Ljubljana, Slovenia, partnered to make the smallest iPhone charger on the go. After a year of work they launched Oivo,[3] a charger that uses AA batteries to power the phone and it's small enough to fit as a keyring.

Oivo was launched on Kickstarter in September 2014. In 18 days they raised more than \$26,000, but the team decided to cancel the campaign due to too many mistakes made in the go-to-market phase.[citation needed] They tried to sell the whole product, but were unsuccessful. The project was abandoned in November 2014. In January 2015 Marin joined forces with an Australian adventurer, Huw Kingston,[4] to become the first to row the Eastern Mediterranean from Tunisia to Turkey.
